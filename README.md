# classified-books

This repository holds:

* classified_books.zip: A zip file with books (as .txt files) whose category is known. 

* 4 clean_book_section_i.zip: zip files with books from the Gutenberg project (obtained and cleaned according to [this gist](https://gist.github.com/mbforbes/cee3fd5bb3a797b059524fe8c8ccdc2b)).

* result_classification.csv: A csv that links file name in the classified_books.zip file to title and category. 

The categorisation was made joining the tags in [this repo](https://github.com/zygmuntz/goodbooks-10k) (first found as a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/zygmunt/goodbooks-10k/version/5)) with the available books at the Gutenberg project.
